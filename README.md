# Secure AWS NAT-Bastion Architecture

This repository demonstrates a secure network setup on AWS using a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a public subnet (with Bastion and NAT Gateway) and private subnet (with isolated EC2 instance). Secure access is enabled via a bastion host while allowing outbound internet access for updates.

## Key Features
- Secure Bastion Host in public subnet for SSH access to private workloads
- Private subnet with NAT Gateway for outbound-only internet access
- VPC and subnet architecture that isolates private instances from direct inbound internet access
